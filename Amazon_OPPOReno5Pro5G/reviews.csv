2,I am gonna to write genuine review for OPPO Reno 5 Pro.First of all thank you OPPO for such a awesome phone.Display wise really 5 out of 5Camera was really superb 😍Come to battery not bad but yes full day enjoy.First time i am using OPPO smartphone but yes alot of extra features compare to OnePlus.Note :- this note is recommended for OPPO band please give one update for battery and front camera. please make sure front camera needed to support AI in Normal selfie and best quality.Yes I am gonna to recommended this phone go-ahead.
3,Excellent mobile with best features in-build Really fast charging .Camera is amazing with 20x zoom AI feature works well while taking pics.Dual video mode works well.The phone weights just 176g which you won't feel having in your hand.Dolby Atmos works amazing.
4,"After 7 days side volume button damaged......Response for this complaints is very slow....Otherwise overall mobile look is good, light weight and process is good."
5,"Phone is awesome no doubt,no lags, stunning curve display, superfast 65 watt charger, but the phone is slightly costlier,it should be around 30k, realme x7 pro is much cheaper than this with extra features,.........and one more thing oppo should have brought this phone in 256 gb varient as well...."
6,"Online replacement policy very bad for 7days only , if purchase at retail outlet they gives 30 days replacement policy . So select good one Amazon purchase or retail purchase , Amazon 7days replacement policy very bad"

32,"Phone is considerably thin and the screen is also very good, sound quality is good. The performance of the phone is fast and smooth. I qould say its at par with One Plus 8T. Cameras are good but not worth the hype. The only major drawback is the battery drainage and slight heating issues. The charger provided with the product is very bulky. Yes, its charges to 100% in 30mins"
